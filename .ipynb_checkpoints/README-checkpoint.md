# Classification-of-Italian-Wine
The objective of this experiment is to analyze the Wine Data Set, analyze which factors contribute to the given classification variable, and train three models (k-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, and Na√Øve Bayes) to accurately classify wine given the attribute set.  

The tools used for this analysis will include the Python programming language, pandas module, and sklearn module. The pandas module will assist with handling the data from ingestion to cleaning and general data manipulation tasks. The sklearn module will assist in the statistical efforts such as determining the variable distribution, normalization of the data, methods of validating the experiment, as well as the models used for classification.
